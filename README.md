# MNIST Handwritten Digits Detector

This project is a web application that uses a pre-trained machine learning model to detect handwritten digits from images. It is implemented using Flask, TensorFlow, and Bootstrap.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nv21053/MNIST-Handwritten-Digits-Detector.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the pre-trained model file (`mnist_model.h5`) and place it in the project root directory.

## Usage

1. Run the Flask web server:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Choose an image of a handwritten digit and click the "Submit" button.

4. The application will predict the digit and display the result along with the probabilities for each digit.

5. To try again, click the "Try Again" button.

## File Structure
